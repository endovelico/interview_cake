# Random Number Generation Problem

You are given a function `rand7()` that generates a random integer from **1 to 7**, inclusive.

## Task

Use `rand7()` to implement a function `rand5()` that generates a random integer from **1 to 5**, inclusive.

## Requirements

- `rand7()` returns each integer from 1 to 7 with **equal probability**.
- `rand5()` must return each integer from 1 to 5 with **equal probability**.
- You may **only** use `rand7()` as your source of randomness.

## Goal

Design `rand5()` so that its output is **uniformly distributed**, despite the different ranges of the two functions.
